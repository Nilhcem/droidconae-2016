			"description": "High-quality software is important for tech companies. It is getting challenged because hundreds of engineers are working on the shared big code base. Unit testing, automation testing and static analysis are very helpful to create error-free code. Static analysis is a technique to detect software errors by analyzing existing codes without running. However, there are pitfalls which cannot be detected by existing tools. Some pitfalls could be related with company coding standards or how to use third-party libraries. For example, string resources should be sorted alphabetically by a string key. In this talk, we suggest a way to avoid those pitfalls collaboratively by utilizing Android custom lint, which is a one of static analysis tool. With Android custom lint, developers easily avoid pitfalls with a nice explanation such as which line and why."

			"description": "As app developers, we want to focus on making our apps better. It is easy to delay thinking about security. But exploits are now targeting developers, for example, XCodeGhost had a massive impact. The F-Droid free developer tools make a secure process vastly easier, and with little change to your workflow, while providing automated uploading to Google Play and F-Droid when posting new apps, releases, their descriptions, and the translations.\n\nThere are also many things that can make it hard to get apps to users. Google Play is blocked in some places, regional app stores are often cesspools of malware. The internet can be disabled or even just plain expensive. People turn to getting apps from websites, email, bluetooth, SD Cards, or any other method they can figure out. In China, the internet is ubiquitous but heavily filtered and monitored; but “collateral freedom” techniques have proven effective. In Vietnam, swapping apps with Bluetooth is widespread. In Cuba, people get apps via mesh networks and by buying “La Paquete”. These techniques work in many places, but none work in all, and it is very difficult to keep track of them all. This requires users, developers, companies, and organizations to be fluent in many technical details in order to effectively get and distribute mobile apps and media around the world.\n\nF-Droid includes all these techniques in system that is easy for developers to plug into. we are focused on providing a simple, smooth user experience, with three use cases in mind:\n- The end user gets a familiar app store experience, regardless of the complexity behind it all\n- The developer is in control of a simple set of commands that automate the entire distribution workflow for easily making highly secure builds, then getting apps out through all possible channels, including Google Play\n- Non-technical organizations and people can use these tools to publish curated collections of apps and media, without getting caught up in the technical details of the whole process."

			"description": "Mobile phones have become central to our private lives, full of intimate messages, private pictures, and a huge amount of details of our personal lives. This private information can easily leak out in so many different ways, yet the user experience feels very private. When we look at our mobile screens, it feels like no one else can see what we are seeing unless we show them. Unfortunately, it is difficult for app developers to deliver on this implicit promise made to users.\n\nFor companies, we see that data about people can be very lucrative business. It is also increasingly apparent that having too much data about users can destroy your business if that information gets hacked and dumped onto the internet.\n\nBuilding apps that can securely contain private can be hard to do, but it does not have to be. Guardian Project’s central goal is to make it as easy as possible. We take cutting edge security research and bundle it up into free, easy to use libraries. These libraries make it very easy to protect precious data on the device and over the internet. These libraries use APIs that developers already know (e.g. android.database.*, java.io.*) so the ramp up time for developers is really fast. This workshop will give an overview of our suite of libraries, including SQLCipher-for-Android, private file stores, and hardened network connections. Then we will help you start incorporating them in your own apps, providing a wealth of examples including sample code, real world apps that use these libraries, and UI/UX patterns that work well."

With your smartphone you can make such a great achievement.\n\nIn this workshop, we will learn how to use Unity3D to create virtual and augmented reality experiences. Using the Vuforia and Google Cardboard SDK, it has never been easier to create such application. We will learn how to use them in the best way possible and more importantly how to make a combination of both of them so we create the best mixed reality experience.\n\nThis workshop will bring to your mobile device the power and control of many years of research and complex algorithm, which were previously available only for researchers. Now with these simple tools, you can make your environment interactive, modify it and a lot more…\n\nYour smartphone will take you to another world with Unity3D; It’s mixed reality, any time, anywhere."

This session will show you some easy optimizations and how to avoid glitches in the application. A lot of developers would shout, that this is premature optimization. In contrary it is preventive. With a small amount of work while developing you can avoid a lot of pitfalls. You will hopefully have a better understanding of the underlying system afterwards. During the session some tools and frameworks will be presented for helping you to fulfill your mission."

			"description": "Lately, Making native looking applications throughout cross-platform tools becomes a reality.\n\nDeploying to multiple platforms(roughly a dozen) and gaining the C++ performance in your application are not the only pros of the Qt cross-platform framework, you can take profit from a more reduced time to market, possible through the new Qt Quick module.\n\nWith the new Qt QML language, your most common app features are made in a record time, it even permit you to write your app entirely in a declarative language including easy to use animation, 3D and all the JavaScript power and simplicity, in the most simple way.\n\nYou can’t have a special application unless you have a powerful back-end, the 20 years old mature framework will help you make your app a distinctive and useful piece of software, the C++ methods from sensor management to image recognition are on your disposal to make the heavy treatments part.\n\nYou can always use your Java intimate snippets in consistency with the other parts of your Qt Android application.\n\nWhatever you’re an old school C++ programmer or newbie JS integrator, this talk will help you get started with the Qt tools and framework to make your android application."

			"description": "In almost every Android app project, you use a variety of libraries. This talk covers some of the most used libraries. While developing an Android app, you rely on loads of 3rd party libraries to make your life easier. Need persistence? No problem. Need to access a REST API? No problem. Need to handle images in your app? No problem. There’s a library for almost any common task that Android developers will face. In this talk, I will show examples of some of the most common Android libraries that are out there."

			"description": "To fully grasp Bitcoin and it’s possibilities a deep understanding of the blockchain is necessary. With this talk I’d like to answer questions like: How are bitcoins exactly ‘created’, what does a wallets balance exactly mean. How does the bitcoin ‘Script’ language work and what are the possible applications of p2sh (pay to script hash). How do Sidechains work and how they link to the original Blockchain. What are HD-Wallets and how do you build them."

			"title": "Taking Wearable Development beyond Android",
			"description": "As Android developers, we’re able to easily create applications for wearable devices such as Android Wear and Google Glass. But, what happens when we need to create an app or custom device simply to get data or functionality that a phone, tablet, or smartwatch doesn’t provide? Prototyping such types of wearable devices used to be something that required specialized skills in embedded development as well as electrical and mechanical engineering. Today, thanks to the maker revolution, we can combine our programming knowledge with basic electronics, soldering skills, and access to a 3-D printer in order to create useful devices. More importantly, there are now boards available that allow developers to interact with them without having to create custom Bluetooth drivers or write C++ firmware.\n\nIn this session, we’ll take a quick tour of some of the options, and then do a deep dive into creating a wearable prototype through code and live demos that use two different approaches:\n\n1. An Arduino board using an Android SDK and a smidgen of C++\n2. The MbientLab MetaWear board using only an Android SDK\n\nBy the end, you’ll have enough information to begin developing your own wearable devices."
