	"description": "Skyscanner and its products have improved over the last year. The Android platform has changed significantly as well, and with it Skyscanner's approach to testing for both the web and native apps on Android.\n\nMatteo Doni (@todoleo) will summarise where Skyscanner was last year, what has changed and explore Test Strategy for the rapidly changing ecosystem. From internal test practices to release processes, crowd testing to analytics and dogfooding to automation, Matteo will deliver an overview of how Skyscanner delivers quality software in over 30 languages and working with over 1200 partners.\n\nHumor and the odd cat picture is guaranteed, time will be put aside for a Q&A session at the end. No goats were harmed in the preparation of this session."

Reactive Programming with RxJava will help you to beat Android Platform limitations to create astonishing Android Apps.\nThis talk will be a practical journey from basic Reactive Programming and Observer Pattern concepts to the main feature of RxJava, with code examples and a real-world app.\nYou will learn how to create an Observable “from scratch”, from a list or from a function you already have in your code base. You will learn how to filter an Observable sequence to create a new sequence containing only the values you want; you will learn how to apply a function to an Observable, how to concatenate or merge Observables. You will learn how to enjoy Schedulers to overcome the threading and concurrency hell in Android.\nI will close the talk with a practical example about RxJava + Retrofit, to easily communicate with a REST API."

	"title": "Crash Wars: The handling awakens",
	"description": "For years crash handling was one of the worst parts of the Android development process. With each new crash you were risking a lot - getting bad Google Play reviews, negative comments and dissatisfied customers. Nobody likes the \"Unfortunately, your app has crashed\" dialog, but there was only so much you could do about it, beside logging the crash to a remote server.\n\nIn the last couple of months a lot has changed. We've been introduced to brand new tools to help us cope with this problem. During this talk, we'll demonstrate how to use several tools and techniques that have made our lives easier. We'll discuss different ways of predicting crashes even before they occur by means of static code checkers, automatic tests and CI setup. Additionally, we'll show you how to detect memory leaks, explain advanced exception and crash logging by using a combination of several different tools. Finally,  we’ll demonstrate how to provide a better crash experience or hide the crash altogether if the crash is simply inevitable!"

	"description": "Have unit tests? How readable are they? How much time do you spend maintaining them? Brittle and time-consuming tests lead to fear, uncertainty, and distrust, and that leads to and eventual disillusionment and abandonment.\n\nThis talk will go over tools and techniques for writing tests that are a pleasure to read, easy to maintain, give you maximum return on the time you invest into them, and will prove their worth time and time again.\n\nWe'll take a look at some example tests that are exhibiting some common issues, such as:\n- readability\n- brittleness: breaking every time the implementation is changed\n- non-obvious cause + solution upon test failure\n- flakiness / unreliability\n- slow execution\n\nWe'll improve these tests in plain JUnit, move on to Hamcrest and AssertJ, and then show how Spock can take us even further to tests that are beautiful, easily maintainable, and incredibly useful.\n\nStop wasting time on bad tests!\n\nThis talk aims to level-up every Android developer's testing know-how and arm them with the tools required to write effective and maintainable tests."
